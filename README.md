# Auto Code Generator

The goal of this project is to build a program that will help reduce human effort that is required in building Page Object Model framework in Selenium. Input for this program takes in Excel file and convert all the indicators in Excel into respective methods in class file.

This is a resuasable plug and play program that would help create POM class files in any project with minimal tweaks.

The entire process has been automated starting from reading data from excel, segregating methods based on elements and creating class file as an output. This output can then be used by different companies and projects to reduce the time required for manual creation of methods and identifiers of elements in Page Object Model.
